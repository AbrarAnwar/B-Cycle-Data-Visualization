# BCycleVisualization
First Attempt at Data Visualization

# Datasets
I am using two datasets so far in this project. The main dataset being the Austin B-Cycle Trips on the Austin open data portal. The dataset can be found on https://data.austintexas.gov/Transportation-and-Mobility/Austin-B-Cycle-Trips/tyfh-5r8s

The other dataset used is the Austin weather dataset, which is found in the repoisitory above.

# What I Learned
Having a project filled with meanigful data to create visualizations of really helps with the learning process. I've learned to modify data and what kinds of plots can be used to create certain visualizations.

# Things to Do in the Future
As I learn more things in this field, I would love to expand on this to get more meaningful visualizations from this data
